Automated import of supplier's articles to Foodsoft

Scripts for specific suppliers get data from their webshop (screen-scraping), spreadsheet, etc. and transform it into a CSV which can be imported into Foodsoft. Foodsoft then compares existing articles of this supplier to the new list and shows a summary of changes, deleted articles, and new articles.
